### Major
* ***Math-Computer Science***
>I am a transfer student. This is my second year at UCSD. I am majoring *Math-Computer Science*. I like coding, so the course that I am taking right now is almost the same as the other CS major students. Hopefully, I can be a software developer in the future.

### Favorite Programming Language
1. **_C++_** 
2. **_Python_** 
3. **_Java_**
 
Here some *C++* Source code displaying a message *Hello World* in the terminal:
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout<<"Hello World";
    return 0;
}
```
### Progress
1. - [x] CSE 110 Design
2. - [ ] Math 103A Homework
3. - [ ] Math 173A Homework
4. - [ ] Math 154 Homework
