### ***Math-Computer Science***
>I am a transfer student. This is my second year at UCSD. I am majoring *Math-Computer Science*. I like coding, so the course that I am taking right now is almost the same as the CS major students. I want to be a software developer in the future. I like playing mobile game in my sparse time.
